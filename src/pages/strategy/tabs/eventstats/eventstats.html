	<div class="help_q">What does "Use Database Information" do?</div>
	<div class="help_a">Instead of using snapshots during your event progress, "Use Database Information" scans all sorties
		made during your event period, allowing for more data to be obtained and displayed. Scanning your data also allows for
		showcases of prior events before XX-XX-XXXX to be generated. However, enabling this feature may result in longer load times.
